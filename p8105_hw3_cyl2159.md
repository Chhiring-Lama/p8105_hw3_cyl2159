## Problem 1

#### Import the data

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

``` r
unique_id <- pull(ny_noaa, id) |> 
  unique() |> 
  length()

start_date <- pull(ny_noaa, date) |> 
  min() |> 
  year()

end_date <- pull(ny_noaa, date) |> 
  max() |> 
  year()
```

This data consists of 2595176 rows and 7 columns. The variable included
in the columns are weather station id, date of observation,
precipitation (tenth of mm), snowfall (mm), snow depth (mm), minimum and
maximum temperature(tenth of $^{\circ}C$). Data from 1981 to 2010 for
747 weather stations are included.

``` r
ny_noaa_clean <- ny_noaa |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>  
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin), 
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax))

snowfall_measure <- ny_noaa_clean |> 
  count(snow) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))

mostcommon_snowfall <- snowfall_measure |> first() |> pull(snow)
second_snowfall <- snowfall_measure |> slice(2) |> pull(snow)
```

To clean the data, we first separate the day, month and year of the date
variable, and converting `tmin` and `tmax` to a numeric variable. We
find that 0 mm is the most common snowfall overall. It makes sense
because it does not snow most of the time during the year in New York.
The second most common value for snowfall is NA which indicates missing
data for snowfall. The next most common values are 25, 13 and 51 which
suggest that snowfall was originally recorded in inches and then
converted to mm.

``` r
ny_noaa_clean |> 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) |> 
  mutate(month = case_when(month == 1 ~ "January", 
                           month == 7 ~ "July")) |> 
  group_by(id, year, month) |> 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE, color = id)) |>
  ungroup() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  facet_grid(~month) +
  labs(title = "Mean monthly temperature for each station across years for January and July", 
       y = "Max Temperature (C)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Above is a two-panel plot showing average monthly max temperature in
January and in July for all the stations. Even though the mean month
weather across different stations for each are different, they fall
within the same range and have similar trend. In years with higher mean
max temperature for a stations, the max temperature for other stations
are also higher. As we would expect, it is much hotter in July than in
January for all the stations between 1981 and 2010. There was an
unusually cold July in 1988, and some less drastic outliers (colder
weather in January of 1982, 2005 and 1994).

``` r
hex_plot <-  ny_noaa_clean |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_hex() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-600, -400, -200, 0, 200, 400, 600)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(-400, -200, 0, 200, 400, 600)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(breaks =c(0, 25000, 50000)) +
  labs(title = "Minimum versus Maximum Temperature", x = "Tmin", y = "Tmax") +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 10))

ridge_plot <- ny_noaa_clean %>% 
  filter(snow < 100, snow > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(title = "Snowfall between 1981 and 2010", x = "Snowfall (in mm)", y = "Year")
  
hex_plot + ridge_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cyl2159_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />
We made a two-panel plot to show `tmax` vs `tmin` overall using hex plot
(left) and per year snowfall distribution (right).For the hex plot,
majority of data cluster around the center of the distributions with
`tmin` being quite close/slightly lower than the `tmax` of the date.
There were fewer instances of where the temperature fluctuated by a lot,
raising questions about the quality of data collected on the day. Most
of the stations experience between 0 and 35 mm of snow per year. The
overall distribution is multimodal, with another two groups of stations
with near 50 mm and 80 mm of snow every year. This likely comes from
converting one system of measure to another (fractions of an inch to
another tenth of mm).

## Problem 2

#### Loading the datasets:

``` r
demographic_df <- read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
accelerometer_df <- read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv")|> 
  janitor::clean_names()

complete_df <- bind_rows(demographic_df, accelerometer_df)
```
